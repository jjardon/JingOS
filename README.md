documents, and even do coding.

## FAQ

Is JingOS free and open-source?

> Yes, JingOS has been open-sourced here on GitHub. And the image files of JingOS can be downloaded from our website.

What is JingOS based on?

> JingOS is based on Ubuntu 20.04, KDE Frameworks 5.75, and Plasma Mobile 5.20.

<!--What’s the roadmap of JingOS?

> I posted about Roadmap v1.0 of JingOS 90 in January. I will update the roadmap
  every quarter.

If JingOS is a tablet OS, does it require apps to respect the life cycle, like
what happens when suspended? How does it manage permission? Is there a
permission system like iOS? Are the apps sandboxed? If it can just run Linux
apps, how would they respect life cycle, permission, and stuff? Will you use
snap/flatpak for the permissions system?

> Life-cycle management API will come with JingOS v0.8 in March, apps designed
  for JingOS can be suspended like any other tablet OSs. The permission system
  and app sandbox are still in discussion, not decided yet.

Compared to other Linux distros, is JingOS optimized for tablet only in the UI /
specialized apps, or are there performance tweaks/features as well. Is it
basically like a gnome / KDE but with a tablet first focussed, or are there any
“lower-level” differences? What kind of lower-level differences? Drivers?
Performance enhancements? What will it help Linux do on tablets especially?

> JingOS v0.6 is mostly optimized only in the UI and specialized apps. But
  JingOS v0.8 would have lots of lower differences, like performance
  enhancements.

Do apps have to be created for JingOS to work well? Could I use Spotify or
Discord apps on it, or would there need to be JingOS versions first? JingOS just
run normal Linux apps, right? So we should be able to build and run Flutter
desktop apps on it? Will JingOS support android apps? To fill the gap with
missing popular apps.

> Linux apps (.deb, etc.) can run in JingOS well. You can run Android apps in
  the JingOS ARM version after v1.0 in June.-->
  
Can JingOS run Android apps?
> JingOS ARM for JingPad A1 can run Android apps. For more information, please go to Wiki
